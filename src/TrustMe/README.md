# Usage



# Background Information

* A certificate's hash does not include it's (optional) signature as the signature is an addition to the basic certificate information. The certificate's hash-with-signature includes the signature to make distinction easier.

# TODO

* Implement generic versions with embedded data
* Implement generic certificate locator with certificate type
* Implement RSA encrypt and decrypt methods
* Implement sample app for decrypting and encrypting data
* Implement sample app for using certificate locator and chain of trust

* Documentation
  * Implement certificate locator and serializers is up to the user
